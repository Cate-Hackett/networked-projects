                <p>Something similar applied to my hair... The alterations started though, around 18 years, starting a never ending attempt to employ and exercise all facets of my identity and queerness. </p>
                <p>I felt each stage of my expression was appropriate for me at that time. Whether it was becoming more modern, trying to refine and be more clean cut, or crafting something with more detail, layers, and interestingness (let me use the incorrect word)</p>
                <p>There's a great interaction between outfits and hair too - sometimes I could wear certain outfits with one hair-do and not the other, feeling as though it upset one of the aforementioned balances I had going.</p>
                <p>Now, if I show someone a picture of me in almost any of my past stages, people take a second glance in disbelief that I'm that same person. All of my different versions have been fantastic to wear, and question what fits. I currently feel like I'm arriving at a place that is most representative of me and all my interests:)</p>
