            <p>Clean. Not too professional. Slightly Personal & Avant... Minimal</p>
            <p>Left side menu bar for “page toggling” almost ; idk i think it's nice and kinda more closely couples the page for comparisons more. </p>
            <p>In a way where it so shows the subpages (hair/fashion) are very related to each other. AND especially feels less like a commerical website / store (lol) … this format feels more personal - maybe almost like a book?</p>

            <p>----------------------------------</p>
            <h2>Process:</h2>
            <p>1. Creative process of planning out 'self expression' pages (4 pages, intro(index), fashion, hair & logic page)</p>
            <p>^ plus inspiration for the set up & aesthetic </p>
            <p>I started out with the index page, starting to figure out how to get that left menu, plus right chunk of content, all within the center of the page</p>
            <p>So I made a list of four links for the menu (at first for the same page)</p>
            <div class="image-holder">
                <div class="img-cap">
                    <img src="images/links.png"width="700px"/>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>2. Then I made the intro content for the right side, and took some time to do the centering I was aiming for</p>
            <div class="image-holder">
                <div class="img-cap">
                    <img src="images/index_intro_content.png" width="700px"/>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>3. So for the styling, I had to center the body, then arrange the link list and right side content as columns, and then center the right side content like the intro photo within itself </p>
            <div class="image-holder">
                <div class="img-cap">
                    <img src="images/index_css.png" width="400px"/>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>4. Now, I played with the formatting for the fashion and hair page (just prototyping the first, and copying it for the second)... but had to adjust the styling again to allow the images to continue to the right so I made this new image holder for those 2 pages:</p>
            <div class="image-holder">
                <div class="img-cap">
                    <img src="images/multi_image_holder.png" width="400px"/>
                    <p>... ^ As you can see that include centering the words for each photo</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>5. Here is the breakdown for the hair and fashion pages themselves</p>
            <div class="image-holder">
                <div class="img-cap">
                    <img src="images/hair_setup.png" width="600px"/>
                    <p>^ you get the idea... and then I did the same for the fashion page</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>And I also did a little formatting / spacing to indicate to the user to scroll to the right using the '& n b s p;' tag</p>
            <br>
            <p>6. For the logic page I actually broke it into 2 additional duplicates of the analysis page practically, I just changed the text and incorporated links to manuever between the 3 depending on if the user read on: </p>
            <div class="image-holder">
                <div class="img-cap">
                    <img src="images/analysis_pg.png" width="700px"/>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </p>
            <h2>Help:</h2>
            <p>I referenced some notes from my class “augmenting the gallery” last semester that began with introing us to front end html css + java to remember how to set up some basics:</p>
            <p>Specifically</p>
            <p>>>how to incorporate images</p>
            <p>>>how to make css style and link it to html like [link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"]</p>
            <br>
            <p>Supplied from our HTML overview class notes:</p>
            <p>>>used nbsp and br for spacing (for example for “scroll”)</p>
            <p>>>using images as links</p>
            <br>
            <p>For centering help - and the different flex layers if you will:</p>

            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>I'm definitely curious how everyone feels about the "scrolling" through spectrum gallery and if its an effective format for this purpose, or alternatives is there's any ideas.</p>
            <p>I also want to know how people feel about this left but centered hand menu</p>
            <p>^ especially because parts of the site are contained in the center, but the image galleries aren't... so part of me wonders if it feels disjointed and if that could be helped.</p>
            <p>OPEN TO ANY FEEDBACK IN GENERAL!</p>
